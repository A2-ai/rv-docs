`rv` cache's aggressively to avoid re-compiling and re-downloading packages and repository databases that have already been used.

Within the cache, each source is its own subdirectory to ensure the correct version of the correct package is installed. 

Before going into details and how to change your caching behavior, let's first consider a quick example:

#### Example

In this example, we'll start with a config file, inspect the output of `rv cache`, and the file tree of the cache as well.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "Config File">
        In this config file, we have two CRAN-like repositories and one git repository.

        ```toml
        // rproject.toml
        [project]
        name = "rv-cache"
        r_version = "4.5"

        repositories = [
            {alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-01-01"},
            {alias = "PPM_new", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest"},
        ]

        dependencies = [
            "fansi",
            { name = "R6", repository = "PPM_new", force_source = true },
            { name = "osinfo", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/osinfo", branch = "main" },
        ]
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "rv cache output">
        The `rv cache` command outputs two things:
        * The cache root - Which in this case is `/Users/rv-user/.cache/rv`
        * Source subdirectories - This lists all the sources, and their corresponding subdirectories, 
        from which packages come from. We will discuss the structure of these for each source type later on this page.

        ```toml
        % rv cache
        /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv
        PPM (https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-01-01 -> c7c3cf56b9), path: /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv/c7c3cf56b9
        PPM_new (https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest -> f4780dda90), path: /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv/f4780dda90
        Git: https://github.com/a2-ai/osinfo, source: /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv/git/8497b6723f, binary: /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv/8497b6723f/4.4/arm64/f815095b7b
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Cache File Tree">
        The cache file structure keeps each repository, R version, architecture, and os flavor (when applicable) isolated to ensure the proper package is 
        installed each time. Also contained for each repository binary type is a `packages.bin` file, 
        referred to as the [Repository Database](#repository-database), which contains an index of each package available in the CRAN-like repository.

        <FileTree>
            - /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv
                - c7c3cf56b9
                    - 4.5/arm64
                        - fansi/1.0.6/
                            - fansi The unzipped, compiled package
                        - packages.bin
                - f4780dda90
                    - 4.5/arm64
                        - R6/2.6.1
                            - R6 The unzipped, compiled package
                        - packages.bin
                    - src
                        - R6/2.6.1
                            - R6 The unzipped, source package
                - git
                    - 8497b6723f Clone of the git repository to build
                - 8497b6723f
                    -4.5/arm64
                        - f815095b7b Git commit sha, not package version
                            - osinfo The unzipped, compiled package

        </FileTree>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Cache Location
The cache follows the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) for Unix like systems 
and the [Known Folder Locations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/known-folders) on Windows.
Within the cache root, `rv` contains its cache within an `rv` subdirectory.

The cache root can be tuned by setting the `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for Unix like systems and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` for Windows.

For additional tunability, use the [`GHQC_CACHE_DIR` env var](../../reference/env_vars/#rv_cache_dir).

## Repository Database

[CRAN-type repositories](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Setting-up-a-package-repository-1) use `PACKAGES` files that contain information about each package present in the repository for each package distribution 
(i.e. source, Mac R 4.5, ubuntu-24.04 R 4.4, etc.). `rv` uses the source PACKAGES file and distribution's binary PACKAGES file
to create a database for the repository.

This database is cached and times out according to the [`PKGCACHE_TIMEOUT`](../../reference/env_vars) environment variable (default 1 hour). 

:::note
Currently, `rv` does not have a direct way to refresh the cached repository databases. 
To force update, you can set the `PKGCACHE_TIMEOUT` to 0 secs to expire the repository databases.

For example, to check if the version you expect will be installed, you can run the following command
```shell
PKGCACHE_TIMEOUT=0 rv plan
```
:::

## Packages

Within the `rv` cache, each source is its own subdirectory 

The details of package caching vary based on the [dependency type](../../config/dependencies).

#### Repository

A repository cache is broken into two components: source and binaries. The binaries are also separated by their platform, 
a combination of R version, OS, and architecture. `rv` will fetch a package to be installed into your library in the following ways:

1. Use the binary package found in the cache
2. Download the binary package from the resolved source (ignored if `force_source`)
3. Compile the package from the cached source package
4. Download the source package from the resolved source and compile

:::caution
An important caveat to the above, if a binary is present but was downloaded and not compiled from source, if a dependency indicates `force_source`
a new source compilation will occur and replace the downloaded binary. 

This is something to always consider when using `force_source`, [`packages_env_vars`](../../config/packages_env_vars), and [`configure_args`](../../config/configure_args)
as changing the compiled binary will effect other packages using the same package binary. 
:::

#### Git

`rv` keeps a source clone of the git repository under the `git` subdirectory, but then also maintains compiled binaries based on the git commits used.

#### Url

`rv` keeps the downloaded package in cache, along with the compiled version if a source package. Upon re-installation of the package,
the package is re-downloaded to ensure the contents match. If they do, the package currently in cache is retained, otherwise, the new version will take its place.

#### Local

`rv` does not keep local packages in the cache. Since the file is already on the system, keeping a cached version is not practical. `rv` does however keep track
of the hash of the source file within the compiled package in the library, therefore re-installation only occurs when the source file changes.

## Global Cache

:::info
The global cache feature is available as of `rv` v0.18.0.
:::

The global cache is a shared cache that organizations can configure to reduce the number of copies of packages across multiple machines and projects. Instead of each project and user maintaining their own complete copy of packages, projects can link against a centralized global cache, significantly reducing disk space usage and redundant downloads.

### How It Works

The global cache works in conjunction with your local cache using a multi-level caching strategy:

1. **Global Cache** - A shared cache (`RV_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR`) that is consulted first. If a package is present in the global cache, it is referenced directly from there
2. **Local Cache** - Your project-specific cache (`RV_CACHE_DIR`) serves as a fallback for packages not found in the global cache

**Linking** - `rv` uses the same linking mechanism (hard-links, copy-on-write, or copying) to link packages from the global cache into your project, avoiding duplication

### Configuration

The global cache is generally configured by system administrators. It can be set using the [`RV_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR`](../../reference/env_vars/#rv_global_cache_dir) environment variable to point to a shared location accessible to all users and machines.

For example, an administrator might configure:
```bash
export RV_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR=/mnt/shared/rv-cache
```

This allows all users and projects on the organization to benefit from a shared pool of pre-compiled packages, reducing network bandwidth and storage costs while maintaining isolation through the local cache layer.
