As discussed in other sections, `rv` is a declarative package manager, which means the user declares the desired project state in a configuration file.
`rv` then takes the list of requirements and resolves them to a list of packages and sources that fulfill the requirements.

## Dependencies
`rv` has two "types" of dependencies:

* ***Direct** Dependencies* - These are the packages explicitly stated in the [dependencies section](../../config/dependencies)
of your config file. Direct dependencies can have additional configurations, which determines the initial list of requirements.

* ***Recursive** Dependencies* - These are the additional dependencies required by the direct dependencies in the config file. 
Most packages depend on additional packages to work correctly. Packages define their dependencies as requirements, often a package and 
acceptable version constraint, and occasionally [a remote source](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#depending-on-the-development-version-of-a-package).

`rv` will resolve the complete dependency tree to ensure all direct and recursive dependency requirements are met before installing packages.

## Repositories
Unlike other language package distribution systems, CRAN only has one version of a package available at any point in time. 
Which means to install different versions, different sources must be specified.

We'll see this in the following examples:

### Example 1 - Single Repository
Let's consider the following dependency and repository information:

<Card title = "Package and Repository Information">
    ###### Repositories Content
    <FileTree>
    - repo1
        - `foo 1.0.0`
        - `bar 1.0.0`
    </FileTree>
    
    ###### Dependencies Requirements
    * `foo 1.0.0` depends on `bar >= 1.0.0`
    * `bar 1.0.0` has no dependencies.
</Card>

Now consider the following config file excerpt:
```toml
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
]
dependencies = [
    "foo"
]
```

In this example, the tooling determines the requirements to be:
    * Direct Dependencies:
        * `foo`
    * Recursive Dependencies:
        * `bar >= 1.0.0`

Since there is only one source, the resolution is `foo 1.0.0` and `bar 1.0.0` from `repo1`

### Example 2 - Two Repositories
Example 1 was simple, `foo` and `bar` MUST be sourced from `repo` since it is the only option. But `rv` allows for multiple repositories.

Let's consider the following dependency and repository information:
<Card title = "Package and Repository Information">
    ###### Repositories Content
    <FileTree>
    - repo1
        - `foo 1.0.0`
        - `bar 1.0.0`
    - repo2
        - `foo 2.0.0`
        - `bar 2.0.0`
    </FileTree>
    
    ###### Dependencies Requirements
    * `foo 2.0.0` depends on `bar >= 2.0.0`
    * `foo 1.0.0` depends on `bar >= 1.0.0`
    * `bar 1.0.0` and `bar 2.0.0` have no dependencies
</Card>

The addition of another repository, and more package versions, leads to multiple ways to resolve.

#### Example 2.1 - Order Matters

##### Example 2.1.1 - `repo1` first

Given this config file excerpt:
```toml
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
]
dependencies = [
    "foo"
]
```

Given this set-up, we have the following requirements:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `foo`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar >= 2.0.0` if `foo 2.0.0`
    * `bar >= 1.0.0` if `foo 1.0.0`

Since `repo1` is first in the config file, we prefer packages to be sourced from that repository. If we try `foo 1.0.0` from `repo1`, we keep the requirement
that `bar >= 1.0.0`, meaning `bar 1.0.0` can also be sourced from `repo1`, the preferred repository. 
Therefore, we end up with the same resolution as Example 1: `foo 1.0.0` and `bar 1.0.0` from `repo1`.

##### Example 2.1.2 - `repo2` first
Let's now switch the repositories section so that `repo2` is first:
```toml {3}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
]
dependencies = [
    "foo"
]
```

This set-up leads to the same requirements:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `foo`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar >= 2.0.0` if `foo 2.0.0`
    * `bar >= 1.0.0` if `foo 1.0.0`

But in this case, we give preference to `repo2`. If we try `foo 2.0.0` from `repo2`, we keep the more restrictive requirement that `bar >= 2.0.0`, 
but since the preferred repository `repo2` contains `bar 2.0.0` the resolution is `foo 2.0.0` and `bar 2.0.0` from `repo2`.

#### Example 2.2 - Specific Repositories

##### Example 2.2.1 - Resolvable
Let's return to [Example 2.1.1](#example-211---repo1-first) where `repo1` is first, but this time ensuring I get `foo 2.0.0` from `repo2`:
```toml {7}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "foo", repository = "repo2" },
]
```

With this configuration, we have an additional requirement for the source of `foo`:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `foo` from `repo2`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar >= 2.0.0` if `foo 2.0.0`
    * `bar >= 1.0.0` if `foo 1.0.0`

Since `foo 2.0.0` is in `repo2`, we keep the more restrictive requirement of `bar >= 2.0.0`. 
Source `bar 1.0.0` from the preferred repository `repo1` does not meet the requirement, therefore we override this preference and source `bar 2.0.0` from `repo2`.
Thus, the resolution ends up being the same as if `repo2` was first: `foo 2.0.0` and `bar 2.0.0` from `repo2`.

##### Example 2.2.2 - Unresolvable
Sometimes, resolution from a configuration is not possible. 

For example, consider the following config file excerpt:
```toml {8}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "foo", repository = "repo2" },
    { name = "bar", repository = "repo1" },
]
```

With this configuration, we have an additional requirement for the source of `bar`:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `foo` from `repo2`
    * `bar` from `repo1`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar >= 2.0.0` if `foo 2.0.0`
    * `bar >= 1.0.0` if `foo 1.0.0`

Since `foo 2.0.0` is in `repo2`, we keep the restrictive requirement that `bar >= 2.0.0`. The only way to meet that requirement would be to install
`bar 2.0.0` from `repo2`, but that is in direct conflict with the conflict `bar` must be sourced from `repo1`. 
Therefore, we cannot resolve this configuration.

## Lockfile

In addition to the configuration file, `rv` keeps a lockfile to track the package version and source to recreate the environment.
When a lockfile is present, the source tracked in the lockfile takes precedence over the configuration file. The few exceptions are:
* The config file no longer contains the repository the package is locked as.
* The dependency has a different source specified, or the specified source is removed.

If a lockfile is not needed for your project, set the `[use_lockfile]`(../../config/use_lockfile) config option to false.

The following examples will show how the lockfile works:

### Example 3 - Locked Package

Let's consider the same package and repository information as [Example 2](#example-2---two-repositories):
<Card title = "Package and Repository Information">
    ###### Repositories Content
    <FileTree>
    - repo1
        - `foo 1.0.0`
        - `bar 1.0.0`
    - repo2
        - `foo 2.0.0`
        - `bar 2.0.0`
    </FileTree>
    
    ###### Dependencies Requirements
    * `foo 1.0.0` depends on `bar >= 1.0.0`
    * `foo 2.0.0` depends on `bar >= 2.0.0`
    * `bar 1.0.0` and `bar 2.0.0` have no dependencies
</Card>

For this example, we will have installed `bar` from `repo1` using the following config file, generating the following lockfile:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Lock File">
        <Code code = {ex_3_lock} lang="toml" title = "rv.lock" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Config File">
    ```toml ins={3}
    //rproject.toml
    repositories = [
        { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
    ]
    dependencies = [
        "bar"
    ]
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Example 3.1 - New Repository
We first will add `repo2` as the first repository in this config file excerpt:

```toml ins={3}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
]
dependencies = [
    "bar"
]
```

Without the lockfile, the resolution would be simple, and similar to [Example 2.1](#example-21---order-matters), 
`bar 2.0.0` would come from `repo2` since that repository comes first. But the presence of the lockfile adds additional
requirements:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `bar`
* From Lockfile:
    * `bar 1.0.0` from `https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1`

Since all requirements are met by using the version in the lockfile, the resolution ends up being `bar 1.0.0` from `repo1`.

#### Example 3.2 - Dropped Repository
Let's now remove `repo1` from the config file. By removing the repository from the config file, you are communicating to `rv` packages should not
be sourced from `repo1` anymore.

```toml del={4}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
    # { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
]
dependencies = [
    "bar"
]
```

Therefore, by removing the source `bar` is locked to, we remove the requirement that `bar` must come from `repo1`:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `bar`
* ~From Lockfile:~
    * ~`bar 1.0.0` from `https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1`~

Since the only requirement is that `bar` is installed and we have one source, the resolution is `bar 2.0.0` from `repo2`

#### Example 3.3 - Additional Dependencies
In this example, we'll add `foo` into the project in two different ways, one that is compatible with the locked version of `bar` and one that is not.

##### Example 3.3.1 - Incompatible Locked Version
Let's return to [Example 3.1](#example-31---new-repository) and add `foo` to the dependencies field.

```toml ins={8}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
]
dependencies = [
    "bar",
    "foo",
]
```

Since `foo` is not within the lockfile, we consult the repository and get these requirements:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `bar`
    * `foo`
* From Lockfile:
    * `bar 1.0.0` from `repo1`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar >= 1.0.0` if `foo 1.0.0`
    * `bar >= 2.0.0` if `foo 2.0.0`

Since `repo2` is listed first, we prefer packages to be sourced from that repository. Since `foo 2.0.0` meets all requirements and comes from the preferred
repository, `repo2`, we choose to use this version. This leads to conflicting requirements on `bar` since `bar 1.0.0` cannot come from `repo1` 
AND `bar >= 2.0.0` since `foo 2.0.0`. In this case, we prefer to ignore the lockfile requirement and resolve to `foo 2.0.0` and `bar 2.0.0` from `repo2`.

##### Example 3.3.2 - Compatible Locked Version
Like we have discussed in [other sections](../../commands/intro#project-status), one of the benefits of `rv` is the ability to resolve and see what will happen
before it actually occurs. `rv plan` will resolve and show what would occur upon calling `rv sync`, as seen below.

```shell
% rv plan
+ bar (2.0.0, binary from https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2)
+ foo (2.0.0, binary from https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2)
```

If the outcome is not desired, you can change the config file as needed. In this scenario, we can either:
    1. Make `repo1` the first repository
    2. Specify `foo` should be sourced from `repo1`

Since changing the repositories order could change the installation behavior of other packages as they are added, we will only specify `repo1` for `foo`.

```toml ins={8}
//rproject.toml
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
    { alias = "repo1", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo1" },
]
dependencies = [
    "bar",
    { name = "foo", repository = "repo1" },
]
```

This configuration leads to the following requirements:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `bar`
    * `foo` from `repo1`
* From Lockfile:
    * `bar 1.0.0` from `repo1`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar >= 1.0.0` if `foo 1.0.0`
    * `bar >= 2.0.0` if `foo 2.0.0`

Since `foo` is specified to come from `repo1`, we start with `foo 1.0.0`. This gives us the requirement that `bar >= 1.0.0`, 
therefore the locked version of `bar 1.0.0` is compatible with the rest of the requirements, making the resolution `foo 1.0.0` and `bar 1.0.0` from `repo1`.

## Remotes
In [Overriding Remotes](../../cookbook/remotes) and [`prefer_repositories_for`](../../config/prefer_repositories_for),
we have discussed Remotes resolution, but we'll discuss further in this section. 

Within a package's DESCRIPTION file, the Remotes field can be set to install a dependencies from a nonstandard place. This often occurs when developing one package
alongside a development version of another. This is discussed further in the [R package book](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#sec-dependencies-nonstandard).

`rv` always respects the Remotes field of a package, unless the [`prefer_repositories_for`](../../config/prefer_repositories_for) configuration is specified.

We'll see how this resolution works in the following example:

### Example 4 - Remote Dependencies

Let's consider the following package and information:
<Card title = "Package and Repository Information">
    ###### Repositories Content
    <FileTree>
    - repo2
        - `foo 2.0.0`
        - `bar 2.0.0`
    </FileTree>
    
    ###### Dependencies Requirements
    * `foo 2.0.0` depends on `bar >= 2.0.0`
    * `bar 2.0.0` has no dependencies
</Card>

Additionally, we have the following new packages/versions:
* `bar 2.0.0.9000` - in development on the main branch of `my-org/bar`
* `baz 1.0.0.9000` - in development on the main branch of `my-org/baz` 
    
    Below is an excerpt from the `baz` DESCRIPTION file:
    <Code code={ex_4_DESC} lang="txt" title="DESCRIPTION"/>
    > By not specifying a reference (tag/branch) on the remote, the latest commit on the default branch will be installed. 
    > If `my-org/bar@dev` is specified, then the `dev` branch is installed.
#### Example 4.1 - Installing from Remotes

In this example, we will install `baz` from its git repo using the following config file excerpt:

```toml
// rproject.toml
repositories = [
    { alias = "repo2", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo2" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "baz", git = "https://github.com/my-org/baz", branch = "main" },
]
```

To start resolution, `rv` consults the DESCRIPTION file of `baz` and ends up with the following requirements:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `baz` from `my-org/baz@main`
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * `bar` from `my-org/baz`
    * `bar >= 2.0.0.9000`

Since `bar` is specified as a remote in `baz`, the resolution is `baz 1.0.0.9000` from `my-org/baz@main` and `bar 2.0.0.9000` from `my-org/bar@main`.

#### Example 4.2 - Satisfying Package Version in Repository
The previous example did not have multiple resolutions since `bar 2.0.0` from `repo2` did not meet the requirement set by the `baz 1.0.0.9000` DESCRIPTION file,

We'll next look at what occurs if `bar 3.0.0` was released in `repo3`.

The package and repository info for `repo3` is as follows:
<Card title = "Package and Repository Information">
    ###### Repositories Content
    <FileTree>
    - repo3
        - `foo 2.0.0`
        - `bar 3.0.0`
    </FileTree>
    
    ###### Dependencies Requirements
    * `foo 2.0.0` depends on `bar >= 2.0.0`
    * `bar 3.0.0` has no dependencies
</Card>

Let's keep the same configuration file as [Example 4.1](#example-41---installing-from-remotes), but with `repo3` instead:

```toml ins={3}
// rproject.toml
repositories = [
    { alias = "repo3", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo3" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "baz", git = "https://github.com/my-org/baz", branch = "main" },
]
```

Despite a compatible version now being available in the repository, the resolution is the exact same as [Example 4.1](#example-41---installing-from-remotes)! 
If a remote is listed, `rv` will install the dependency from the remote, unless that dependency is listed in [`prefer_repositories_for`](../../config/prefer_repositories_for).

#### Example 4.3 - Installing from Repository
There are a number of reasons to not want to install a dependency from a remote, and also plenty of reasons to want to install from the remote.
One of the reasons may be that the dependency is now available in a repository and there is no need to continue to compile the package from the git repository.
This is the scenario we started to see in the [example above](#example-42---satisfying-package-version-in-repository).

Starting with the same repository/package information and config file as [above](#example-42---satisfying-package-version-in-repository), we'll add `bar` to the 
[`prefer_repositories_for`](../../config/prefer_repositories_for) section in the config file.

```toml ins={3}
// rproject.toml
repositories = [
    { alias = "repo3", url = "https://cran-like-repo.com/repo3" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "baz", git = "https://github.com/my-org/baz", branch = "main" },
]
prefer_repositories_for = [
    "bar",
]
```

The requirements now become:
* Direct Dependencies:
    * `baz` from `my-org@main`
    * **`bar` from repository**
* Recursive Dependencies:
    * **`bar` from `my-org/baz`**
    * `bar >= 2.0.0.9000`

We now have two source requirements for `bar`. In order for the configuration requirement to "overrule" the Remote, we need to ensure the conditions
for [`prefer_repositories_for`](../../config/prefer_repositories_for) are met:
    1. ✅ The dependency has a version requirement within the DESCRIPTION file
        - `bar >= 2.0.0.9000` is within the `baz` DESCRIPTION file
    2. ✅ There exists a package matching that version requirement within a repository
        - `bar 3.0.0` is within `repo3` and meets the version requirement `>=2.0.0.9000`

Since both conditions are met, the configuration requirement of `bar` being sourced from a repository is preferred over the Remote. 
Therefore the resolution is `baz 1.0.0.9000` from `my-org/baz@main` and `bar 3.0.0` from `repo3`.

If either of the conditions for `prefer_repositories_for` were not met, the resolution would have included `bar` from `my-org/bar@main`,
like the resolution in the [example above](#example-42---satisfying-package-version-in-repository).
