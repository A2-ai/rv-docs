## Why can't I load my package? It is listed my config file and I ran `rv sync`

If you are getting an error like the following
```ansi
> library(dplyr)
[31mError in `library()`:
! there is no package called 'dplyr'
Show Traceback[0m
```

It is likely because your `.libPaths()` is not set to the `rv` library path.

There are a few reasons this can occur:

### 1. Your `.Rprofile` is not sourcing `rv/scripts/activate.R`
    * Run restart R or run `source(".Rprofile")`. After either, you should see a message containing the following:
        ```txt
        rv libpaths active!
        library paths: 
            /Users/rv-user/projects/prism-pkg-pub/rv/library/4.4/arm64
            /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library
        ```
    * Ensure `rv/scripts/activate.R` is present in your directory. If it is not, run `rv activate` and restart R.
    * Ensure `source("rv/scripts/activate.R")` is present in your `.Rprofile`. If it is not, add it as the first line

### 2. You are launching a background job from a subdirectory that does not contain a `.Rprofile`
