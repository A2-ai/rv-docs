description: Environemt variables used/respected in rv
---

`rv` respects existing environment variables and introduces a few as well. This page contains information about 
what each does and how it effects `rv`:

## `PKGCACHE_TIMEOUT`
`rv` keeps a cached version of the [repository database](../cache/#repository-database), which tracks which package versions are available in the repository.
It is in seconds, and defaults to 3600, or 1 hour, and corresponds to the `PKGCACHE_TIMEOUT` environment variable in 
[`pkgcache`](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgcache?tab=readme-ov-file#package-environment-variables).

## `RV_NUM_CPUS`
`rv` parallelizes as much as possible. By default, `rv` will use all CPUs available to make the installation as fast as possible, but for some users
(especially in cloud computing environments) setting a cap on the number of CPUs to use may be useful.

## `RV_NO_CHECK_OPEN_FILE`
On certian file systems, particularly NFS, packages which are loaded in R are locked and can not be removed until they are unloaded. `rv` by default checks
if any of the packages in the library are open (or in use) and does not allow a sync if any of those packages need to be removed. To override this behavior,
this variable can be set to `true` or `1` to not check for open files if the file system is known to not have these issues.

## `RV_SYS_REQ_URL`
For certain linux distributions, currently Ubuntu and Debian, `rv` will check if the system dependencies for packages are found. To determine each package's system dependencies, 
`rv` consults [Posit Package Manager's api](https://packagemanager.posit.co/__api__/repos/cran/sysreqs) by default. This environment variable can be used
to tune where `rv` determines the system dependencies from.

## `RV_SYS_DEPS_CHECK_IN_PATH`
For certain linux distributions, currently Ubuntu and Debian, `rv` will check if the system dependencies for packages are found. To check if the system dependencies
required for this project are installed, `rv` consults the [`dpkg` database](https://debian-handbook.info/browse/da-DK/stable/sect.manipulating-packages-with-dpkg.html#sect.dpkg-list),
a list of [known dependencies on the path](#known-path-dependencies), and any dependencies set by this environment variable in a comma separated list.

#### Known Path Dependencies
`rv` declares the "known" dependencies on the path as: `rustc`, `cargo`, `pandoc`, `texlive`, `chromium`, and `google-chrome`.

## `RV_LINK_MODE`
`rv` aggressively [cache's](../../concepts/cache) in order to avoid re-compiling and re-downloading pages. Additionally,
caching minimizes the disk space used by installed packages. By default, `rv` will hardlink for Windows and Linux and ]copy on write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) for Mac
