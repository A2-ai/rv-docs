`renv` is the most popular R package manager in the R ecosystem.
It helps you ["create reproducible environments for your R projects"](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

But `renv` is not without its issues, many of which lead to the decision to create `rv`. To fully grasp these issues, 
we need a bit of `renv` background.

## `renv`

In `renv`, users iteratively install packages, then retroactively "snapshot" the current project status to generate a lockfile by calling `renv::snapshot`.

[The lockfile contains 3 main components](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#infrastructure):
* `Version` - The R version used in the project
* `Repositories` - A list of repositories where packages were installed from. This is generated by whatever repositories are set in `options("repos")`
* `Packages` - Contains information about each package used in the project, derived from the installed package's DESCRIPTION file, including its name, version, and data useful
to recreate the installation.

A `renv` snapshot is exactly what it sounds like, it "snapshots" the project status by inspecting the R version, set repositories, and installed packages. 
This sounds okay in theory, but in practice, these iterative, retroactive snapshots miss crucial information about how, when, and from where a package is installed.

## `rv`

`rv` takes a completely different approach than `renv`. Instead of iteratively installing packages and retroactively capturing the state, `rv` holistically installs the packages
you require in your library, ensuring the full dependency tree is resolvable before any package is installed. Even as you add new packages to your project, `rv` is ensuring each 
package is compatible with the library at each installation.

Additionally, because `rv` is handling installation and locking in one step, tracking of how, when, and from where packages are installed can be done more precisely, 
completely removing the risk of missing information.
