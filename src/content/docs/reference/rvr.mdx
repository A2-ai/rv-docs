`rvr` is short for `rv` for R, and is the planned name for the R package. In the meantime, `rv` projects are initialized
with a `.rv` R environment, allowing you to access select dependencies and objects directly from your console and R code.

The `.rv` R environment is small in scope by design, encouraging small, allowing small, common tasks to be performed directly in R,
but less common commands and options are kept only in the terminal to maintain simplicity.

To access the `.rv` functions, you must be in an activated `rv` project and call `.rv`, followed by a `$`, then your command.

The 4 commands available in `.rv` are:
* `.rv$sync()`
* `.rv$add(..., dry_run = FALSE)`, where `...` are the packages to add
* `.rv$plan()`
* `.rv$summary(json = FALSE)`

Additionally, `.rv$config_path` will return the path to the config file in the project.
