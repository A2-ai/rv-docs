This section will walk through how to start with your first `rv` project, from creating an rv project, to familiarizing yourself with the configuration file, to installing your first package.

## Start a new project
To start a new project, use `rv init`:
```bash
rv init hello_world
```

`rv init` will create generate the following project structure:

<FileTree>
- hello_world/
    - rv/
        - library/
        - scripts/
            - activate.R  sets .libPaths and option("repos")
            - rvr.R  sets up .rv environment
        - .gitignore  ignores library/
    - .Rprofile  used to run rv/scripts/* to set-up project
    - **rproject.toml**
</FileTree>

We will discuss the other files in a later section, but will focus on the `rproject.toml` first:

import init_config from '../../../configs/init_config.toml?raw';

<Code code = {init_config} lang="toml" title = "rproject.toml" />

This is called the config file, and it allows you to configure which packages you'd like to install, from where they are sourced, and how they are installed.

## Config File Basics

Before continuing, let's familiarize ourselves with the main components of the config file:

#### `name`
A name for your project. Defaults to the name of the directory, but has no requirements.

#### `r_version`
The R version for the project. During `rv init`, this is set by default to the version found on the path

WARNING: If using RStudio/Positron, the R version on the path does not always match the version selected.

#### `repositories`
The repositories dependencies are sourced from by default. During `rv init` defaults to the repositories set in `options("repos")` when possible.

#### `dependencies`
The main element of the file. This is where you specify your dependencies, and options are how and from where they are installed.

## Installing a Package

Instead of individual, iterative package installation, `rv` takes a wholistic approach.
Dependencies are "synchronized" across the config file, lock file, and project library 
to ensure the project is in the expected, working state at all times. 

Therefore, to install packages from the config file, the command is `rv sync`.

To install our first package using `rv`, we will edit the config file's `dependencies` section to include `dplyr`:

import first_dplyr from '../../../configs/first_dplyr.toml?raw';

<Code code={first_dplyr} lang="toml" title = "rproject.toml" mark = '"dplyr"'/>

Then we will run `rv sync`, which will install `dplyr` and all of its dependencies:

```bash
rv sync
+ cli (3.6.5, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 530ms
+ dplyr (1.1.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 509ms
+ fansi (1.0.6, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 421ms
+ generics (0.1.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 317ms
+ glue (1.8.0, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 382ms
+ lifecycle (1.0.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 379ms
+ magrittr (2.0.3, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 360ms
+ pillar (1.10.2, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 458ms
+ pkgconfig (2.0.3, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 287ms
+ R6 (2.6.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 339ms
+ rlang (1.1.6, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 553ms
+ tibble (3.2.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 407ms
+ tidyselect (1.2.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 374ms
+ utf8 (1.2.5, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 427ms
+ vctrs (0.6.5, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 476ms
+ withr (3.0.2, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 401ms
```

Additionally, a lock file is generated within the project, containing information about each package installed, 
including the version, dependencies, and source, making the project directory look like the following:
<FileTree>
- hello_world/
    - rv/
        - library/
        - scripts/
            - activate.R 
            - rvr.R
        - .gitignore
    - .Rprofile
    - rproject.toml
    - **rv.lock**
</FileTree>
