This section will walk through how to start with your first `rv` project, from creating an rv project, to familiarizing yourself with the configuration file, to installing your first package.

## Start a new project
To start a new project, use `rv init`:
```bash
rv init hello_world
```

`rv init` will create generate the following project structure:

<FileTree>
- hello_world/
    - rv/
        - library/
        - scripts/
            - activate.R  sets .libPaths and options("repos")
            - rvr.R  sets up .rv environment
        - .gitignore  ignores library/
    - .Rprofile  used to run rv/scripts/* to set up project
    - **rproject.toml**
</FileTree>

We will first focus on the `rproject.toml` file, as it is what users primarily interact with, while 
the other files will be discussed in additional sections.

The `rproject.toml` is the default name for `rv`'s configuration file, which allows users to declare and configure their
desired project environment. During project initialization, the `rproject.toml` is pre-populated with information found in 
your R session.

Below is what the `rproject.toml` in the project initialized above may look like:

import init_config from '../../../configs/init_config.toml?raw';

<Code code = {init_config} lang="toml" title = "rproject.toml" />

## Config File Basics

Before continuing, let's familiarize ourselves with the main components of the config file:

#### `name`
A name for your project. Defaults to the name of the directory, but has no requirements.

#### `r_version`
The R version for the project. During `rv init`, this is set by default to the version found on the path.

The [`r_version` page](../../config/r_version) contains additional information on how `rv` finds the [R executable.](../../config/r_version/#finding-the-executable)

WARNING: If using RStudio/Positron, the R version on the path does not always match the version selected.

#### `repositories`
The repositories dependencies are sourced from unless otherwise specified. During `rv init` defaults to the repositories set in `options("repos")` when possible.

#### `dependencies`
The main element of the file. This is where you specify the packages (known as dependencies) used in your project, and options about how and from where they are installed.

## Installing a Package

Instead of individual, iterative package installation, `rv` takes a holistic approach.
Dependencies are "synchronized" across the config file, lock file, and project library 
to ensure the project is in the expected, working state at all times. 

Therefore, to install packages from the config file, the command is `rv sync`.

To install our first package using `rv`, we will edit the config file's `dependencies` section to include `dplyr`:

import first_dplyr from '../../../configs/first_dplyr.toml?raw';

<Code code={first_dplyr} lang="toml" title = "rproject.toml" mark = '"dplyr"'/>

Then we will run `rv sync`, which will install `dplyr` and all of its dependencies:

```bash {1}
% rv sync
+ cli (3.6.5, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 530ms
+ dplyr (1.1.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 509ms
+ fansi (1.0.6, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 421ms

```

Additionally, a lock file is generated within the project, containing information about each package installed, 
including the version, dependencies, and source, making the project directory look like the following:
<FileTree>
- hello_world/
    - rv/
        - library/
        - scripts/
            - activate.R 
            - rvr.R
        - .gitignore
    - .Rprofile
    - rproject.toml
    - **rv.lock**
</FileTree>
