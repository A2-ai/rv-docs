description: How to install rv across systems
---

These commands should be run in terminal/powershell to install `rv`.
`rv` is a cli tool at this time, not an R package, and must be primarily used as such.

## Homebrew (macOS)
```shell
brew tap a2-ai/homebrew-tap
brew install rv
```

## From the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/a2-ai/rv/releases/latest).

### Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)
```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A2-ai/rv/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
rv --version
```

### Windows
For now, you can download the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` zip archive from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/a2-ai/rv/releases/latest) 
and extract it to a directory of your choice. Then add the `rv` binary to your PATH.
```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\path\to\rv"
.\rv.exe --version
```
