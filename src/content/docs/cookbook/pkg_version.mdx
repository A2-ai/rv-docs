title: Installing an Older Package Version from a Snapshot
description: Installing an older package version from a repository snapshot
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As mentioned in [the repository dependency configuration note](../../config/dependencies#repository),
`rv` intentionally does not have a way to specify a version directly. Instead, you can add an older snapshot 
and [specify an out of order repository](../../config/dependencies#detailed) or install a package 
using the a direct [`url` configuration](../../config/dependencies#url). 

<Aside type="note">
Consider the scenario where we would like to install `jsonlite 1.9.1` but `jsonlite 2.0.0` is the version available in the repository
used by other packages.
</Aside>

### Through an Older Snapshot 

We must first determine a snapshot that contains the version of interest. 
Looking at [`jsonlite` in Posit Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/repos/cran/packages/overview?search=jsonlite), 
we see that `2.0.0` is release on 27-Mar-2025 and `1.9.1` is released on 03-Mar-2025, therefore any snapshot date between those two dates will contain `1.9.1`.

We will add this repository snapshot AFTER the more up-to-date repository.

Then we add the dependency, specifying it to come from the new snapshot using the alias.

```toml ins={8}
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "archive"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01" },
    { alias = "PPM_old", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-03-13" },
]

dependencies = [
    { name = "jsonlite", repository = "PPM_old" }, # Will install from PPM_old
]
```

### Installation Results
Below is the result of syncing the project.By utilizing a snapshot repository, we are able to still get a binary, 
which is much faster than source compilation of an archive version as seen in the [archive example](../archive_pkg).

```shell
% rv sync
...
+ jsonlite (1.9.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-03-13) in 632ms
```

Additionally, by adding the older snapshot date, if dependency constraints from the older package version cannot be met
in the newer repository, dependencies can come from the older repository. 

<Aside type="note">
Mixing repository dates should be done with caution. CRAN's guarantee for package compatibility is lost by adding a package from a 
different moment in time. Understand what other dependencies rely on the package you are changing and what behavior may change before
mixing packages.
</Aside>

## Through an Archive/Tarball

As mentioned in [the repository dependency configuration note](../../config/dependencies#repository),
`rv` intentionally does not have a way to specify a version directly. Instead, you can install a package 
using the [`url` configuration](../../config/dependencies#url) to install a package from the archive
or add an older snapshot and [specify an out of order repositories](../../config/repositories#detailed), as seen in the
[older snapshot example](../snapshot_pkg).

In this example we would like to install `jsonlite 1.9.1` and `cli`, but `jsonlite 2.0.0` is the version available in the repository.
### Config File

In the config file, we add the dependency using the [`url` configuration](../../config/dependencies#url) to point to the Archive.
In a CRAN-like repository, packages are found in the archive in the pattern `{repo url}/src/contrib/Archive/{pkg name}/{pkg name}_{pkg version}.tar.gz`

```toml {14}
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "archive"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    # This repository can be any CRAN mirror. For this example, setting a stable snapshot for reproducible versions.
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01" },
]

dependencies = [
    # "jsonlite", # would install `jsonlite 2.0.0`
    { name = "jsonlite", url = "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/jsonlite/jsonlite_1.9.1.tar.gz" },
]
```

### Installation Results
Below is the result of syncing the project. Notice, all other packages (including potential dependencies of the archived package) are sourced from the specified repository.

```shell
% rv sync
...
+ jsonlite (1.9.1, source from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/jsonlite/jsonlite_1.9.1.tar.gz) in 2549ms
```

<Aside type="caution">
Adding a package from the archive will always be a source compilation, thus if you want binaries for speed, consider using the
older snapshot method instead, though that is less clear as to why you are targeting an entire repository.
