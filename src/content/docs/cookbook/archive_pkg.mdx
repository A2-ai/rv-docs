title: Installing an Older Package Version from Archive
description: Installing an older package version from the archive using the `url` configuration option.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As mentioned in [the repository dependency configuration note](../../config/common_config/#repository),
`rv` intentially does not have a way to specify a version directly. Instead, you can install a package 
using the [`url` configuration](../../config/common_config/#url) to install a package from the archive
or add an older snapshot and specify an out of order repositories, as seen in the
[older snapshot example](../cookbook/older_snapshot).

In this example we would like to install `jsonlite 1.9.1` and `cli`, but `jsonlite 2.0.0` is the version available in the repository.
### Config File

In the config file, we add the dependency using the [`url` configuration](../../config/common_config/#url) to point to the Archive.
In a CRAN-like repository, packages are found in the archive in the pattern `{repo url}/src/contrib/Archive/{pkg name}/{pkg name}_{pkg version}.tar.gz`

```toml {14}
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "archive"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    # This repository can be any CRAN mirror. For this example, setting a stable snapshot for reproducible versions.
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01" },
]

dependencies = [
    "cli",
    # "jsonlite", # would install `jsonlite 2.0.0`
    { name = "jsonlite", url = "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/jsonlite/jsonlite_1.9.1.tar.gz" },
]
```

### Installation Results
Below is the result of syncing the project. Notice, all other packages (including potential dependencies of the archived package) are sourced from the specified repository.

```shell
% rv sync
+ cli (3.6.5, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01) in 595ms
+ jsonlite (1.9.1, source from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/jsonlite/jsonlite_1.9.1.tar.gz) in 2549ms
```

<Aside type="note">
Add a package from the archive should be done with caution. CRAN's guarantee for package compatibility is lost by adding a package from a 
different moment in time. Understand what other dependencies rely on the package you are changing and what behavior may change before
mixing packages.
