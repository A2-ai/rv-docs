title: Overriding Remote Dependencies
description: Overriding Remote dependencies in internal/development packages
---

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Sometimes packages, especially internal or still in development, have dependencies which are not widely available.
In this case, the package may contain the `Remotes` field to describe where the installer can find these dependencies.

This is great for a lot of scenarios, for example, if you want to install the package, the installer just "knows" how to install a package.

But there are scenarios where a package is contained in a repository and the installer, including `rv`, still prefers the remote dependency

As discussed in [`prefer_repositories_for`](../../config/prefer_repositories_for), `rv` has the power to prefer repositories
over remotes for explicit dependencies following the conditions mentioned.

In this example, we will try to install the simple example package [`rv.remotes`](https://github.com/a2-ai/rv.remotes), 
which depends on `tibble >= 3.2.0` and `glue >= 1.7.0`, but has remotes specified for those packages as well. First, we'll look at how the installation
would occur without additional configuration. Then, we'll add the `prefer_repositories_for` field to the config file and see how it changes.

## Without Additional Configuration

In the initial configuration, we start with a repository which contains `tibble 3.2.1` and `glue 1.8.0` and try to install the `rv.remotes` package
from the main git branch.

```toml
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "remotes"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01" },
]

dependencies = [
    { name = "rv.remotes", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/rv.remotes", branch = "main" }
]
```

We can see in the `summary` and `plan` that we will install `tibble` and `glue` from the specified git remote, and not from the repositories.

## With Configuration

Since we have packages in the repository that meet the version requirements in `rv.remotes` DESCRIPTION file, we can prefer the repository for those packages.

We do this by first adding it to the config file:

```toml
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "remotes"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01" },
]

dependencies = [
    { name = "rv.remotes", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/rv.remotes", branch = "main" }
]

prefer_repositories_for = [
    "glue",
    "tibble",
]
```

We can now see that `tibble` and `glue` are not sourced from GitHub anymore and are sourced from the repository as specified.

<Aside type = "note" title = "An interesting side effect">
For keen observers, you'll notice the `fansi` package is installed as well when `prefer_repositories_for` is set.
This is because `fansi` was dropped as a dependencies in [`tibble v3.2.1.9022`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/compare/v3.2.1.9021...v3.2.1.9022).
Therefore, by installing an earlier version (`3.2.1`) from the repository, we do not have the dependency removed.
