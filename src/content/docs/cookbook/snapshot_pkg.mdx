title: Installing an Older Package Version from a Snapshot
description: Installing an older package version from the archive using the `url` configuration option.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As mentioned in [the repository dependency configuration note](../../config/common_config/#repository),
`rv` intentially does not have a way to specify a version directly. Instead, you can add an older snapshot 
and [specify an out of order repository](../../config/common_config/#repository) or install a package 
using the `url` configuration to install a package from the archive, as seen in the [archive package example.](../archive_pkg)

In this example we would like to install `jsonlite 1.9.1` and `cli`, but `jsonlite 2.0.0` is the version available in the repository.

### Config File

We must first determine a snapshot that contains the version of interest. 
Looking at [`jsonlite` in Posit Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/repos/cran/packages/overview?search=jsonlite), 
we see that `2.0.0` is release on 27-Mar-2025 and `1.9.1` is released on 03-Mar-2025, therefore any snapshot date between those two dates will contain `1.9.1`.

We will add this repository snapshot AFTER the more up-to-date repository.

Then we add the dependency, specifying it to come from the new snapshot using the alias.

```toml ins={8}
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "archive"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01" },
    { alias = "PPM_old", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-03-13" },
]

dependencies = [
    "cli", # Will install from PPM
    # "jsonlite", # would install `jsonlite 2.0.0`
    { name = "jsonlite", repository = "PPM_old" }, # Will install from PPM_old
]
```

### Installation Results
Below is the result of syncing the project.By utilizing a snapshot repository, we are able to still get a binary, 
which is much faster than source compilation of an archive version as seen in the [archive example](../archive_pkg).

```shell
% rv sync
+ cli (3.6.5, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-05-01) in 595ms
+ jsonlite (1.9.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2025-03-13) in 632ms
```

Additionally, by adding the older snapshot date, if dependency constraints from the older package version cannot be met
in the newer repository, dependencies can come from the older repository. 

<Aside type="note">
Mixing repository dates should be done with caution. CRAN's guarantee for package compatibility is lost by adding a package from a 
different moment in time. Understand what other dependencies rely on the package you are changing and what behavior may change before
mixing packages.
