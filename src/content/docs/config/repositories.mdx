description: Specify which repositories to install packages from
---

import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A list of CRAN=like repositories to fetch packages from. Packages will be installed from the first repository
a resolvable version is found in, thus the **order matters**!! For more information, refer to the [Resolution section.](../../concepts/resolution)
By default, packages are fetched as binaries when possible.

## Options
* `alias` - Used for self-organization and to specify a certain repository source for a [dependency](../dependencies#repository)
* `url` - The URL to the CRAN-like repository from which to fetch packages
* `force_source` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Force all packages coming from the repository to be source
    > Default: `false`

:::tip
To improve reproducibility across systems, linux binaries are fetched using the pattern set by [Posit Package Manager](https://docs.posit.co/rspm/admin/serving-binaries.html#using-linux-binary-packages).
Therefore, it is recommended to not include the additional linux path elements required in base R.
:::

## Example
```toml
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
    { alias = "BioCsoft", url = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/bioc", force_source = true },
]
```

## Other Repositories
Currently, `rv` is tuned to best support CRAN and PPM style repositories, but there are a few specific repositories to call out:

### Bioconductor
Bioconductor is _just_ a collection of CRAN-like repositories. In R itself, tools like `BiocManager` expands the repositories and sets them,
so that when you call `install.packages()` it will search through them to find the package of interest.

While it is likely we will include a configuration to handle the repository expansion internally, the onus currently is on the user.

Below is an example expansion, where the [bioconductor version](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/) 
and [which repositories](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html) to include can vary based on the R version and 
packages of interest:

```toml
repositories = [
    { alias = "BioCsoft", url = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/bioc" },
    { alias = "BioCann", url = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/data/annotation" },
    { alias = "BioCexp", url = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/data/experiment" },
    { alias = "BioCworkflows", url = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/workflows" },
]
```

### R-Universe
R-Universe is formatted like a CRAN-like repository, but is missing a critical component: there is [no archive](https://docs.r-universe.dev/install/reproducibility.html#does-r-universe-archive-old-versions-of-packages-how-does-it-work-with-renv).
Since reproducibility is at the forefront of design considerations with `rv`, we currently consider packages sourced from R-universe 
as [git dependencies](../dependencies#git) from the beginning. While this may lead to a temporary slow down due to compilation, it is more reproducible.
We may consider downloading compiled binaries for available packages in the future if the need arises.
