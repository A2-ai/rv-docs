description: Packages to install that the project depends on

import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This is the main element of the config file and is most commonly edited. It specifies which packages 
(or project _dependencies_) to install in your project, as well additional options to tune the installation.

There are 4 types of dependency configurations, sorted by their source, each of which have individual configurations corresponding with them.

All dependencies types have the following configurations:
* `install_suggestions` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Install the suggested dependencies of the package 
    > Default: `false`
* `dependencies_only` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Install only the dependencies of the package, not the package itself. Used primarily for package development. 
    > Default: `false`

## Repository
The most common/default type. These packages will be sourced from the CRAN-like repositories listed in the
[repositories](../repositories) section, preferring binaries unless otherwise specified.

### Configurations
#### Simple
A simple string can be listed if no configuration required for the package. These packages will be installed from the
first resolvable repository.

#### Detailed
* `name` - The name of the package
* `repository` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Used to specify that a package must come from a specific repository
by indicating an alias corresponding to the [repositories](../repositories) section
    > Default: first resolvable repository
* `force_source` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Force the package to be fetched as source
    > Default: `false`

:::tip
Specifying `force_source = false` will override the repository level `force_source` configuration. This is different
than omitting the flag completely and can be useful for packages that have long compilation times.
:::

### Example
```toml
dependencies = [
    "dplyr",
    { name = "purrr", force_source = true },
    { name = "ggplot2", repository = "CRAN" },
    { name = "tibble", force_source = true, repository = "PPM" },
]
```

:::note
`rv` does not directly support the installation of specific package versions from repositories. 

In a CRAN-like repository, only one package version is available at a time. 
While this is often inconvenient, CRAN also provides the guarantee that all packages are compatible with each other at any point in time.

In order to take advantage of this stability win, we have consciously decided to not add direct version support yet. 
Adding additional repository snapshot date(s) containing the versions of interest, and specifying the `repository` 
argument can often lead to the same result, in a more stable manner.

## Git
Used to install packages from a git repository from either a branch, tag, or commit reference. Requires the `git` CLI to be available.

### Configurations
* `name` - The name of the package. Must match the name of the package found in the repository
* `git` - The git repository url. Either http or SSH
* `tag` or `branch` or `commit` - Must specify one and only one git reference. `commit` must be the full git sha.
* `directory` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - a (sub)directory inside of the repository containing the R package, 
if the package is not at the repository root.
    > Default: `None`

### Example
```toml
dependencies = [
    { name = "git-tag", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/git-tag", tag = "v1.0.0" },
    { name = "git-commit", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/git-commit", commit = "bc50e550e432c3c620714f30dd59115801f89995" },
    { name = "git-branch", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/git-branch", branch = "main", directory = "r" },
]
```

## Local
Install a package from a local source. Can be a directory or archive containing a source or binary R package.

### Configurations
* `name` - The name of the package. Must match the name of the package found at the path.
* `path` - The path pointing to the package directory or archive


### Example
```toml
dependencies = [
    { name = "local-dir", path = "path/to/my/package", dependencies_only = true },
    { name = "local-archive", path = "path/to/my/archive.tar.gz" },
]
```

## URL
Install a source or binary package directly from a URL.

### Configurations
* `name` - The name of the package. Must match the name of the package found at the url.
* `url` - The url pointing to the package archive from which to download.

### Example
```toml
    { name = "dplyr", url = "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dplyr/dplyr_1.1.3.tar.gz" },
```
