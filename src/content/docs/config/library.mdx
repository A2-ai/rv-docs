title: library
description: A custom library path
---

By default, `rv` install packages within the project directory, in the subdirectory `rv/library`, which is further name spaced by
R version, arch, and, for linux OS, the OS codename. Therefore, the default library path is `<project directory>/rv/library/<R version>/<arch>/<linux codename>`.

However, packages can be installed to any directory using the `library` configuration. `rv` will not do any name spacing, so the burden is on
the user to ensure the correct set of packages is used across R versions and systems. 

To increase reproducibility, `rv` does not consider a package as installed if this option is set since tracking how packages are installed is not as well controlled.

## Example
```toml ins={2}
//rproject.toml
library = "/opt/rpkgs/4.5"
[project]
name = "custom library"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    "dplyr",
]
```
