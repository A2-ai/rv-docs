description: Prefer repositories for dependencies over a remote
---

In packages, especially non-public packages, the `remotes` field in the DESCRIPTION file is used to specify
where a dependency should be sourced from.

By default, `rv` will always follow the remotes defined in a DESCRIPTION file, but it is sometimes useful to override this
behavior. Therefore, `rv` provides a way to override this behavior by adding the package name to this array. 

In order for the override to take effect, the following conditions must be met:
1. The dependency has a version requirement within the DESCRIPTION file
2. There exists a package matching that version requirement within a repository

If a package does not list a version requirement in the DESCRIPTION file, we will ALWAYS install from the remote.

For more information and a detailed example of how this works and how to use it refer to the [Remotes Cookbook](../../cookbook/remotes)

## Example
In this example, package `foo` depends on `bar >= 0.0.1` and has a Remotes field of `org/foo@main`. In order to install `bar` 
from `my-repo`, we specify it in `prefer_repositories_for`.

```toml
//rproject.toml
name = "project"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "my-repo", url = "https://my-repo.com" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "foo", git = "https://github.com/org/foo", branch = "main" },
]

prefer_repositories_for = [
    "bar"
]
```
