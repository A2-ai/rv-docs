description: Set a custom lockfile name
---

By default, `rv`'s lockfile name is `rv.lock`. For most project situations having one configuration file corresponding to one lockfile is ideal.
But since `rv` allows for custom configuration file names, which opens the door for multiple configuration files in the same directory, a custom
lockfile name can be useful to keep the lock file's separate from each other.

## Example

```toml ins={2}
//rproject.toml
lockfile_name = "custom.lock"
[project]
name = "custom lockfile name"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    "dplyr",
]
```
