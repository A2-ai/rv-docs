One of the main benefits of using `rv` is the ability to declare the desired project state of the project, 
instead of iteratively installing packages trying to reach the desired state. To accomplish this, 
`rv` uses a configuration file, allowing users to declare which packages should be installed into the project,
as well as how and from where they are installed. 

This configuration file was designed to provide a simple, reproducible way to manage packages, approachable for those 
without a computer science background, while being powerful and flexible enough to fit the most demanding developer needs.

On this page, we will detail the most common configuration options.

## `name`
The `name` field is not used by `rv`, but is required for your own organization. 
Recommended to have the same name as the directory/repository.

```toml
name = "common configurations"
```

## `r_version`
`rv` will look on the path, and in `/opt/R` for unix-like systems, for the R version specified in the config.
The version must contain at least the major and minor version and is hazy matched to the version(s) found on the system.
For example, `4.4` will match `4.4.1` and `4.4.2`, but `4.4.1` will only match `4.4.1`.

``` toml
r_version = "4.4"
```

<Aside type="note">
R packages are compatible across patch versions of R, 
therefore for most situations it is recommended to specify only the major and minor to increase cross-system compatibility.

## `repositories`
A list of CRAN-like repositories to fetch packages from. The order in which the repositories are listed matters. For example, if a package is listed in two repositories, 
`rv` will install it from the first repository a resolvable version can be found in. Packages will be installed as binary when found by default.

##### Options:
* `alias` - Used for self-organization and to specify a dependency to come from a certain repository.
* `url` - The CRAN-like from which to fetch packages from. Linux binaries are automatically found using the [Posit Package Manager spec](https://docs.posit.co/rspm/admin/serving-binaries.html#using-linux-binary-packages).
* `force_source` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Force all packages coming from the repository to be source. 
    > Default: `false`

```toml
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2024-01-01" },
    { alias = "CRAN", url = "https://cran.r-project.org", force_source = true },
]
```

## `dependencies`
This is the main element of the config file, most commonly edited. It specifies which packages (or project "dependencies")
to install in your project, as well as some options to further tune the installation.

There are 4 types of dependency configurations, sorted by their source, each of which have individual configurations corresponding with them.

All dependencies types have the following configurations:
* `install_suggestions` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/>: Install the suggested dependencies of the package 
    > Default: `false`
* `dependencies_only` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/>: Install only the dependencies of the package, not the package itself. Used primarily for package development. 
    > Default: `false`

### Repository
The most common/default type. The packages will be sourced from the CRAN-like repositories listed 
in the `repositories` section, preferring binaries unless otherwise specified.

##### Configurations:
* `name` - The name of the package.

* `repository` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Used to specify that a package must come from a specific repository, 
by setting to the alias corresponding alias from the `repositories` section.
    > Default: first resolvable repository
* `force_source`<Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Force the package to be fetched as source. 
    > Default: `false`

```toml
dependencies = [
    "dplyr", # a simple string is equivalent to `{ name = "dplyr" }`
    { name = "purrr", force_source = true },
    { name = "ggplot2", repository = "CRAN" },
]
```

<Aside type = "note">
`rv` does not directly support the installation of specify package versions from repositories. 

In a CRAN-like repository, only one package version is available at a time. 
While this is often inconvient, CRAN also provides the guarantee that all packages are compatible with each other at any point in time.

In order to take advantage of this stability win, we have conciously decided to not add direct version support yet. 
Adding additional repository snapshot date(s) containing the versions of interest, and specifying the `repository` 
arguement can often lead to the same result, in a more stable manner.

### Git
Used to install packages from a git repository from either a branch, tag, or commit. Requires the `git` CLI to be available.

##### Configurations:
* `name` - The name of the package. Must match the name of the package found in the repository.
* `git` - The git repository url.
* `tag` or `commit` or `branch` - Must specify one. `commit` must be the full hash.
* `path` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - a path to a subdirectory inside of the repository containing the R package
    > Default: `None`
```toml
dependencies = [
    { name = "git-tag", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/git-tag", tag = "v1.0.0" },
    { name = "git-commit", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/git-commit", commit = "bc50e550e432c3c620714f30dd59115801f89995" },
    { name = "git-branch", git = "https://github.com/a2-ai/git-branch", branch = "main", path = "r" },
]
```

### Local
Install a package from a local source. Can be a directory or archive containing a source or binary R package.

##### Configurations:
* `name` - The name of the package. Must match the name of the package found at the path.
* `path` - The path pointing to the package directory or archive

```toml
dependencies = [
    { name = "local-dir", path = "path/to/my/package", dependencies_only = true },
    { name = "local-archive", path = "path/to/my/archive.tar.gz" },
]
```

### URL
Install a source or binary package directly from a URL.

##### Configurations:
* `name` - The name of the package. Must match the name of the package found at the url.
* `url` - The url pointing to the package archive from which to download.

```toml
    { name = "dplyr", url = "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dplyr/dplyr_1.1.3.tar.gz" },
```
