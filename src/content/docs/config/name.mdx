The `rv` config file requires the name field to be present. `rv` does not actively use the name field,
but is required for the users organization. 

In [`rv init`](../../commands/init) and [`rv migrate renv`](../../commands/migrate_renv), the name field 
defaults to the name of the directory, which is the recommended, but not required, behavior for development.

## Example
```toml
name = "project name"
```
