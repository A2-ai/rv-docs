title: Introduction to Project Configuration
description: Introduction to the various options available within the rv configuration file.
---

One of the main benefits to using `rv` is the ability to declare the desired state of the project, instead of iterative installations trying to reach the desired state.
To accomplish this, `rv` uses a configuration file, allowing users to declare:
* **What** packages should be installed
* **Where** each package should be installed **from**
* **Where** the packages should be installed **to**
* **How** each packages is installed

The configuration file was designed to provide a simple, reproducible way to manage packages, approachable and simple for easy adoption, 
but powerful and flexible enough to fit the most demanding needs.

In this section, we will go into each configuration, sorting them based on need and functionality:

### Required Fields
The first set of configurations are the fields that are required and most commonly used. These options must be under the `[project]` header.

#### Options

* [`name`](../name) - A name for your project
* [`r_version`](../r_version) - The R version for which to install packages
* [`repositories`](../repositories) - A list of CRAN-like repositories to fetch packages from. The order matters!
* [`dependencies`](../dependencies) - A list of dependencies to install

#### Example Simple Config File
```toml
//rproject.toml
[project]
name = "simple"
r_version = "4.5"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]

dependencies = [
    "dplyr",
    "ggplot2",
]
```

### Metadata
Like the `name` field, the following fields have been reserved to provide you the flexibility to make the config file the centralized hub of your project, 
but are not used by `rv` at this point.

* `description`
* `license`
* `authors`
* `keywords`
* `urls`

#### Example Metadata Config File
```toml ins = {13-22}
//rproject.toml
[project]
name = "metadata"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    "dplyr",
    "ggplot2",
]

description = "This example project shows the additional reserved metadata fields"
license = "MIT License"
authors = [
    { name = "my name", email = "my-email@email.com", maintainer = true },
    { name = "their name", email = "their-email@email.com" },
]

[project.urls]
homepage = "https://my-website.com"
issues = "https://my-website.com/issues"
```

### Package Compilation
On top of the [`dependencies`](../dependencies) section configuration available, `rv` provides additional configurations and controls for package installation.

* [`prefer_repositories_for`](../prefer_repositories_for) - Used to prefer repositories for dependencies that may be listed as `Remotes` in another package.
* [`packages_env_vars`](../packages_env_vars) - Used to specify package specific environment variables for compilation. Has no effect if the package is sourced as a binary.
* [`configure_args`](../configure_args) - Used to specify package specific configure.args. Can be tuned by OS and arch. Has no effect if the package is sourced as a binary.

> `dev_dependencies` and `suggests` are reserved fields for further dependency control, but are not yet implemented.

### Project Options
`rv` provides configurations for the project as well, including the ability to tune the lock file and a custom library location. These are used outside of the `[project]` header.

* [`library`](../library) - Specify a custom library location
* [`use_lockfile`](../use_lockfile) - Whether to use a lockfile or not
* [`lockfile_name`](../lockfile_name) - The name of the lockfile corresponding to the config file
