description: A configuration whether to use a lockfile or not
---

By default, `rv` uses a lockfile to ensure packages are sourced from the same location with the same version on each installation and
across systems. While `rv` is designed at its core to be a project package manager, it can also be used as a package installer.
In this case, `use_lockfile` can be set to `false` and no lockfile will be used during [dependency resolution](../../concepts/resolution).

Without this configuration option, `rv` will completely invalidate a project library and re-sync if a lockfile is not present since it is 
unable to track the source with full confidence. This is because `rv` was designed with reproducibility at front of mind. In `rv`, opting out of 
using the lockfile is equivalent to opting out of the reproducibility guarantees and therefore does not invalidate a project library 
when the lockfile is absent.

## Example
```toml ins={2}
//rproject.toml
use_lockfile = false
[project]
name = "no lockfile"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    "dplyr",
]
```
