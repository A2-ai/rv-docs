Similar to [`packages_env_vars`](../packages_env_vars), `rv` aims to powerfully install packages, with package specific configuration
available. Similar to R's [`install.packages()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/install.packages), 
`rv` allows you to set `configure.args` per package, but it additionally gives the ability to provide different `configure.args` per OS and arch.

:::caution
As discussed in the [Cache Concept Section](../../concepts/cache), changing the compilation of a package may effect other projects. If 
the desired behavior is to keep the compilation change isolated to this project, we recommend setting your cache directory 
(using `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for unix-like systems) to a separate directory to ensure this does not impact other projects.
:::

## Options
* `name` - Name of the package for which the configure args impact
* `args` - The `configure.args` for the package compilation
* `os` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Operating system for which to apply the `configure.args`
    > Default: All
* `arch` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - The system architecture for which to apply the `configure.args`
    > Default: All

## Example
```toml ins={13-21}
// rproject.toml
[project]
name = "env vars"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "foo", force_source = true },
    { name = "bar", force_source = true },
]

[project.configure_args]
"foo" = [
    { os = "macos", args = ["--some-flag"] },
    { arch = "x86_64", args = ["--some-other-flag"] },
]
"bar" = [
    { args = ["--this-flag"] },
    { os = "macos", arch = "arm64", args = ["--that-flag"] },
]
```
