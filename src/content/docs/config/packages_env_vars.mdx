description: Environment variables used for individual package compilation
---

While `rv` is primarily a project specific package manager, it is continually being developed to powerfully install packages
in ways not possible with other R package installers. Other package installers use global environment variables during compilation, 
which is an acceptable option with iterative package installers. Since `rv` takes a holistic approach, tuning environment 
variables per package is more important, even required in certain scenarios.

This flag will not have any impact if a package is available as a binary and the `force_source` flag is not used. 

:::caution
As discussed in the [Cache Concept Section](../../concepts/cache), changing the compilation of a package may effect other projects. If 
the desired behavior is to keep the compilation change isolated to this project, we recommend setting your cache directory 
(using `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for unix-like systems) to a separate directory to ensure this does not impact other projects.

## Example
```toml ins={12-13}
//rproject.toml
[project]
name = "env vars"
r_version = "4.5"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "data.table", force_source = true },
]

[project.packages_env_vars."data.table"]
OPENMP_CFLAGS = ''
```
