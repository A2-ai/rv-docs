title: r_version
description: Specify which R version to use for the project.
---

The R version to install packages for, containing at least the major and minor versions.

## Finding the Executable
The R version is found on the system according to the following guidelines:

### Version Matching
`rv` utilizes a flexible version matching approach, similar to [Posit Connect's `major-minor`](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/r/#r-version-matching) approach. 
If the patch version is specified, it will perform an exact match. If the patch version is not specified, it will match to any R version found 
with the same major and minor version. 

For example, if R `4.5.0` and `4.5.1` are found on the system, the following matches will occur:
* `r_version = "4.5"` → `4.5.0` and `4.5.1`
* `r_version = "4.5.0"` → `4.5.0`

Since R packages are compatible across patch versions of R, it is recommended to specify only the major and minor version
to increase cross-system compatibility.

### Known Binary Locations
`rv` will look to find the specified versions of R first on the path, then in the following locations based on OS:
* **Linux** - Searches within the subdirectories of `/opt/R` (i.e. `/opt/R/4.5.0/bin/R`)
* **MacOs** - [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) keeps all installed versions of R on the path as `R-<MAJOR>.<MINOR>-arch`.
If the executable exists, will check the version to ensure it matches the specified version, even if it is not the version selected by rig.
* **Windows** - [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) keeps the installed/selected version as R.bat, therefore we check for `R.bat` on the path as well.

:::note
For interactive sessions of R in an rv project, if the R version does not match the R version in your config, a warning will appear.
`rv` does not use the current R session, so packages may be installed for versions of R that your session is not currently using.
