[Common Configurations](../common_config) details the most commonly used configuration fields - 
the project `name`, `r_version`, `repositories`, and `dependencies`. While these fields are the most commonly used, 
there are more configurations to be aware of.

## Additional Metadata

Like the `name` field, the `description`, `license`, `authors`, `keywords`, and `urls` fields have been 
reserved to provide you the flexibility to make the `rv` config file the centralized hub of your project, 
but are not used by `rv` at this point.

```toml {3-4, 11-20}
[project]
name = "additional metadata"
description = "This example project shows the additional reserved metadata fields"
license = "MIT License"
r_version = "4.4"
repositories = [ 
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" }, 
]
dependencies = [ "dplyr" ]

authors = [
    { name = "my name", email = "my-email@email.com", maintainer = true },
    { name = "their name", email = "their-email@email.com", },
]

[project.urls]
homepage = "https://my-website.com/homepage"
issues = "https://my-website.com/issues"
```

## "Advanced" Configurations

The following configurations are for additional control, typically used for developers or admins.

### `library`
By default, `rv` will install packages in the project directory in a `rv/library` folder, 
which is further name spaced by R version, arch, and OS.

However, you can set it to any directory, and packages will be installed to that directory, without namespacing.
`rv` will never consider a package as installed if this option is set since we do not have the same level of control of 
how packages are installed.

This is particularly useful if you want a common folder across projects or users.

```toml {1}
library = "/opt/R/4.4.1"
[project]
...
```

### `lockfile_name`
By default, `rv`s lockfile is named `rv.lock`. For most project situations having one configuration file
corresponding to one lock file is ideal. But for some more complex situations or administrator tasks,
having multiple configuration files, each corresponding to a unique lock file is required.

```toml {1}
lockfile_name = "specific_rv.lock"
[project]
...
```

### `use_lockfile`
By default, `rv` uses a lockfile to ensure packages are sourced from the same location on each installation. 
Sometimes, this may not be helpful to you and would rather use `rv` as an installer, not a package manager. 
In this case, `use_lockfile` can be set to `false` and no lockfile will be used during dependeny resolution.

```toml {1}
use_lockfile = false
[project]
...
```

### `prefer_repositories_for`
In packages, especially non-public packages, the `remotes` field in the DESCRIPTION file is used to specify
where a dependency should be sourced from.

By default, `rv` will always follow the remotes defined in a DESCRIPTION file, but it is sometimes useful to override this
behavior. Therefore, `rv` provides a way to override this behavior by adding the package name to this array. 

In order for the override to take effect, the following conditions must be met:
1. The dependency has a version requirement within the DESCRIPTION file
2. There exists a package matching that version requirement within a repository

If a package does not list a version requirement in the DESCRIPTION file, we will ALWAYS install from the remote.

```toml {10-12}
[project]
name = "advanced example"
r_version = "4.4"
repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]
dependencies = [
    { name = "vitals", git = "https://github.com/tidyverse/vitals", commit = "a1d0407f7c156fba283adcc46cd1d151e8dd488a" }
]
prefer_repositories_for = [
    "ellmer"
]
```

<Aside type = "note">
While `ellmer` is a remote dependency of `vitals` at this commit, it does not have a version requirement,
therefore this override would not take effect.

# Reserved, unimplemented configurations
`dev_dependencies` and `suggests` are reserved fields for further dependency control, but are not yet implemented.
