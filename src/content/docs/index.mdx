# What is `rv`?
`rv` is a R package manager, written in Rust, to help users install and manage R packages in a declarative, reproducivle, and fast way. 

Similar to tools like [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), [`Cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), and [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli),
`rv` uses a configuration and lock file to allow the flexibility to determine how, from where, and what is installed, 
while maintaining reproducibility across systems and users.

# Why `rv`?

TODO: Summarize some of the HN + Reddit posts + pkgr
