description: Activate and deactivate rv projects
---

Occasionally, activating and deactivating an `rv` project is required. These commands turn on/off the 
`rv` library path, repositories, and [rvr](../../reference/rvr) from use in your R session. R should be restarted after
using these commands in interactive sessions.

## `rv activate`
Activate a previously initialized project. This command will set up the .Rprofile to activate the `rv` library paths and `.rv` R environment.

### Usage
```shell
rv activate [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options
* `--no-r-environment` - Disable the `.rv` R environment. See [`rvr`](../../reference/rvr) for more information.

## `rv deactivate`

Deactivate a previously initialized project. This command will turn off the `rv` library paths and `.rv` R environment for use.

### Usage
```shell
rv deactivate [OPTIONS]
```
