description: Summary of the project

`rv summary` is a way to inspect your project on a global level. It indicates information about the detected system 
(including R version), how many packages are installed, how many packages need to be installed/removed, where packages come from,
and how many packages are available in the repositories.

### Usage
```shell
rv summary [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options
* `--r-version` - Specify an R version different than the one in the config. This allows you to see what would occur if
the project was changed to a different R version. The R version does not need to be on the system

### Example
In this example, we start out with `tibble` installed and want to install the dev version of `dplyr` from GitHub.

```toml ins={12}
//rproject.toml
[project]
name = "example"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]

dependencies = [
    "tibble",
    { name = "dplyr", git = "https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr", branch = "main" },
]
```

The summary will then show a summary of the state of the project, including information about the systen, dependency status, 
and the repositories listed in the config.
