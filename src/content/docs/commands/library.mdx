title: rv library
description: List the library directory
---

Returns the relative path of the library in UNIX format, even on Windows. 

The library is by default `rv/library/<R version>/<arch>/<linux codename>` (with the linux codename only appearing on linux OSs).
This can be tuned using the [`library`](../../config/library) configuration.

### Usage
```shell
rv library [OPTIONS]
```

### Example
```shell {1}
% rv library
rv/library/4.4/arm64
```
