title: rv init
description: Initialize a project for use with rv
---

import { Badge, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

`rv init` will initialize a new or existing project by:

1. Setting up the project infrastructure, including the project library and activation scripts.
2. Create configuration file which is populated with the R version and repositories

## Usage

```shell
rv init [project_directory] [OPTIONS]
```

#### Arguments

* `project_directory` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Creates an `rv` project at the directory specified

    > Default: current directory (`./`)

#### Options

* `--r-version` - The R version is set to be the version found on the path by default. 
Use this flag to set a custom version.

* `--no-repositories` - The repositories are set to what is found in the current R profile,
in `option("repos")`, by default. This flag leaves the repositories field in the config file blank.

* `--add` - The dependency field is blank by default. This flag can be used to add dependencies you know 
will be needed to the project immediately. It does not sync these dependencies like [`rv add`](../add).

* `--no_r_environment` - By default, `rv` creates an R environment `.rv` to enable `rv` to be called in R code 
(see [rvr](../../reference/rvr) for more info). This flag will disable this R environment.

* `--force` - By default, if an `rproject.toml` exists within a directory already, `rv` will not overwrite the file.
The flag will force the creation of a new config file.

:::note
* For RStudio/Positron users, the R version on the path does NOT always match the version set for the session. 
Please use `--r-version` to ensure the correct R version is used for the project.

* `rv init` will not automatically sync your project

* For interactive R sessions, we recommend restarting R after initializing your project to ensure your 
project is activated properly.

* To determine the default repositories, an `Rscript` command is launched from the working directory. 
Depending on the locations of your [`.Rprofile`s](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/environments/r/managing-r.html#rprofile), 
this may affect the repositories found.
