`rv` has 4 types of commands:
* [Project Creation](../project_creation)
* [Package Installation](../package_installation)
* [Project Status](../project_status)
* [Others](../others)

### Options:
Each command has the following global options:
* `--verbose` (`-v`) - increase the logging verbosity
* `--quiet` (`-q`) - decrease logging verbosity
* `--json` - print the output as JSON format. This will ignore the `--verbose` and `--quiet` flag and not log anything.
* `--config-file` (`-c`) - the path to a config file. Defaults to `rproject.toml` in the current directory.
