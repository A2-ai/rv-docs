description: Migrate a renv project to rv

import { Badge, Code, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

`rv migrate renv` will initialize an existing renv project by:
1. Setting up the project infrastructure, including the project library and activation scripts.
2. Migrating your renv.lock file to a `rv` config file.

We cannot guarantee `rv` will migrate your renv project in its entirety, but any dependencies not fully migrated will be logged.

## Common Migration Issues
Some common reasons a dependency may not be able to be migrated

###  Package not found
If you get the error `Package not found in repositories`, this is because the repository source was not
captured in the `renv.lock` repositories section. 

In order to finish migrating this package, add the package to the `dependencies` field and a repository containg
the package to the `repositories` section.

### Version not found
If you get the error `Package version (1.2.3) not found in repositories Found version 2.3.4 in https://cran.rstudio.com`,
this is because the package version of interest is in the archive and not in any of the repositories directly.

This is the most common error when dealing with `renv` migration. Because `rv` does not support version pinning within the
config file, versions not found to be sourced directly from the repository cannot be specified in the config file. 

In order to finish migrating this package:
1. If the exact version is required and can be found in a different repository, add both the dependency and repository to the config
2. If the exact version is required and cannot be found in a different repository, use the [url dependency format](../../config/common_config#url) to directly access the archive
3. If the exact version is not required, simply add the dependency to the config

## Usage
```shell
rv migrate renv [OPTIONS] [renv_file]
```

### Arguments
* `renv_file` <Badge text="optional" variant="caution"/> - Path to a `renv` lock file to migrate to an `rv` config file in the current working directory.

    > Default: `./renv.lock`

### Options
* `--strict-r-version` - As discussed in the [config `r_version` section](../../config/common_config#r_version), the R version is recommended to only be listed as the major and minor
components. This flag will include the patch in the R version if needed.

* `--no_r_environment` - By default, `rv` creates a R enviroment `.rv` to enable `rv` to be called in R code 
(see [rvr](../../reference/rvr) for more info). This flag will disable this R enviroment

## Example

Let's start with the following `renv.lock`:

```json
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.4.0",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cloud.r-project.org"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "cli": {
      "Package": "cli",
      "Version": "3.6.3",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R",
        "utils"
      ],
      "Hash": "b21916dd77a27642b447374a5d30ecf3"
    },
    "glue": {
      "Package": "glue",
      "Version": "1.7.0",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R",
        "methods"
      ],
      "Hash": "e0b3a53876554bd45879e596cdb10a52"
    },
    "osinfo": {
        "Package": "osinfo",
        "Version": "0.0.1",
        "Source": "Repository",
        "Repository": "a2-ai",
        "Requirements": [],
        "Hash": "854424f3156e9456886cda02d488ddd1"
    },
    "stringi": {
      "Package": "stringi",
      "Version": "1.8.4",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R",
        "stats",
        "tools",
        "utils"
      ],
      "Hash": "39e1144fd75428983dc3f63aa53dfa91"
    }
  }
}

```

In the project containing this `renv.lock` file, we'll run the following command:
```txt {1}
% rv migrate renv
renv.lock was migrated to rproject.toml with 3 unresolved packages: 
    `cli` could not be resolved due to: 
        "Package version (3.6.3) not found in repositories. Found version 3.6.5 in https://cran.rstudio.com"
    `osinfo` could not be resolved due to: 
        "Package not found in repositories."
    `stringi` could not be resolved due to: 
        "Package version (1.8.4) not found in repositories. Found version 1.8.7 in https://cran.rstudio.com"
```

In this case, `rv` was not able to migrate 3 of 4 packages, but provided some important information to aid us in how to 
add those packages to our project and added the successfully migrated package to the config:

```{toml}
// rproject.toml
# this config was migrated from renv.lock on 2025-05-22T00:00:00+00:00[Etc/UTC]
[project]
name = "renv-demo"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "CRAN", url = "https://cran.rstudio.com" },
]

dependencies = [
    { name = "glue", repository = "CRAN" },
]
```

We see the repository and R version listed in the `renv.lock` have both been migrated to the config file. 
`glue` was also added to the config since the available version in the repository at the time of migration 
is the same as the locked version. Note, the repository field is listed explicitly on all migrated packages 
to ensure reproducibility from `renv`.

Next, we'll address the issues and how we'll choose to resolve them:
* `cli` - CRAN does contain this package, but at a higher version. We determine we cannot upgrade to the latest version available,
therefore we will add this package as a [URL dependency](../../config/common_config#url), pointing to the archive.
* `osinfo` - CRAN does not contain this package, but A2-Ai's R-universe does. Therefore, we will add a new repository 
and this package to the config.
* `stringi` - CRAN does contain this package, but at a higher version. We determine we can upgrade to the latest version, 
therefore can simply add the package to the config file.

After making these changes, we get the following config file:

```toml ins = {9, 14-16}
// rproject.toml
# this config was migrated from renv.lock on 2025-05-22T00:00:00+00:00[Etc/UTC]
[project]
name = "renv-demo"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "CRAN", url = "https://cran.rstudio.com" },
    { alias = "a2-ai", url = "https://a2-ai.r-universe.dev" },
]

dependencies = [
    { name = "glue", repository = "CRAN" },
    { name = "cli", url = "https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/Archive/cli/cli_3.6.3.tar.gz" },
    "osinfo",
    "stringi",
]
```
