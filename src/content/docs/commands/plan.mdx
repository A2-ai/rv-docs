title: rv plan
description: See the results of rv sync, without sync-ing
---

`rv plan` will show you what [`sync`](../sync) would do, without sync-ing anything. This is useful to see how the changes to
the configuration file will impact your project before performing any action.

## Usage
```bash
rv plan [OPTIONS]
```

### Options
* `--r-version` - Specify an R version different than the one in the config. This allows you to see what would occur if
the project was changed to a different R version. The R version does not need to be on the system
* `--upgrade` - The same as [`rv upgrade --dry-run`](../upgrade)

## Example
In this example, we start out with `tibble` installed and want to install the dev version of `dplyr` from GitHub.

```toml ins={12}
//rproject.toml
[project]
name = "example"
r_version = "4.4"

repositories = [
    { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" },
]

dependencies = [
    "tibble",
    { name = "dplyr", git = "https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr", branch = "main" },
]
```

The plan will then show us how the project library would change:
```txt {1}
% rv plan
+ dplyr (1.1.4.9000, source from https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr (branch: main))
+ generics (0.1.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
+ R6 (2.6.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
+ tidyselect (1.2.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
+ withr (3.0.2, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
```
