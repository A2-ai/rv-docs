One of the benefits of `rv` is the ability to see what will happen before it occurs, as seen in the `--dry-run` flags in 
the [package installation section](../package_installation). As part of this, `rv` has two commands to indicate the status
of the project, displaying the information differently depending on your needs.

## `rv summary`

`rv summary` is a way to inspect your project on a global level. It indicates information about the detected system 
(including R version), how many packages are installed, how many packages need to be installed/removed, where packages come from,
and how many packages are available in the repositories.

### Flags
* `--r-version` - Specify an R version different than the one in the config. This allows you to see what would occur if
the project was changed to a different R version. The R version does not need to be on the system

### Example
In this example, we started out with `tibble` installed and want to install the dev version of `dplyr` from GitHub.

    <TabItem label="Config File">
        <Code code = {summary_config} lang="toml" title = "rproject.toml" ins={11}/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Command and Output">
        ```shell {1}
        $ rv summary
        == System Information == 
        OS: macos (arm64)
        R Version: 4.4

        Num Workers for Sync: 8 (8 cpus available)
        Cache Location: ~/.cache/rv

        == Dependencies == 
        Library: rv/library/4.4/arm64
        Installed: 11/16

        Package Sources: 
        PPM: 11/15 binary packages
        https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr: 0/1 source packages

        Installation Summary: 
        PPM: 1/4 in cache, 3/4 to download
        https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr: 1/1 in cache (1 to compile)

        == Remote == 
        PPM (https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest): 19429 binary packages, 22420 source packages
        ```
    </TabItem>

## `rv plan`
For a more granual look, `rv plan` will show the results should you run `rv sync`. 

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Config File">
        <Code code = {summary_config} lang="toml" title = "rproject.toml" ins={11}/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Command and Output">
        ```shell {1}
        $ rv plan
        + dplyr (1.1.4.9000, source from https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr (branch: main))
        + generics (0.1.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
        + R6 (2.6.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
        + tidyselect (1.2.1, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
        + withr (3.0.2, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Flags
* `--r-version` - Specify an R version different than the one in the config. This allows you to see what would occur if
the project was changed to a different R version. The R version does not need to be on the system
* `--upgrade` - The same as [`rv upgrade --dry-run`](../package_installation/#flags-1)
