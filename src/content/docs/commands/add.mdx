title: rv add
description: Quickly add packages to the config and sync
---

import { Code, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Used to quickly add packages as [simple dependencies](../../config/common_confi#repository) to the config file, 
then [sync](../sync). 

Using this command may feel similar to `install.packages()` where packages can be iteratively added to the project, 
just with the additional benefits of provided by `rv`.

## Usage
```shell
rv add [packages]... [OPTIONS]
```

### Arguments
* `packages` - A list of packages, space or comman separated, to add to the project

### Options
* `--dry-run` - No changes made to the config or the package library, only reports what would happen if the command was run.
* `--no-sync` - Packages are added to the config file, but not sync'ed.

## Example
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "Initial Config">
        ```toml
        //rproject.toml
        [project]
        name = "my project"
        r_version = "4.4"

        repositories = [
            { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" }
        ]

        dependencies = [
            "tibble",
        ]
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Command and Output">
        ```shell {1}
        % rv add dplyr
        + dplyr (1.1.4, binary from https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest) in 1ms
