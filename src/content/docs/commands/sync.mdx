description: The basic command to install packages using rv
---

import { Code, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Synchronize the config file, lock file, and project library, by removing and/or adding packages, to reach the desired project state.

## Usage
```shell
rv sync [OPTIONS]
```

### Options
* `--save-install-logs-in`: Directory in which the install logs for packages compiled from source should be copied to. By default is kept in cache.

## Example
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "Config File">
        ```toml
        //rproject.toml
        [project]
        name = "my project"
        r_version = "4.4"

        repositories = [
            { alias = "PPM", url = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest" }
        ]

        dependencies = [
            "tibble",
        ]
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Command and Output">
        `rv sync` installs the `tibble` package and all of its dependencies, indicating which version, from where, and
        the time it took for each installed package.
