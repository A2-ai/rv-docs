`rv` has a few other commands available, that are not as frequently used in day-to-day workstreams.

## `rv library`

Returns the relative path of the library in UNIX format, even on Windows. 

### Usage
```shell
rv library [OPTIONS]
```

### Example
```shell {1}
$ rv library
src/configs/rv/library/4.4/arm64
```

## `rv cache`

Returns the absolute paths of the cache and which cache subdirectory corresponds to each repository used in the project.

### Usage
```shell
rv cache [OPTIONS]
```

### Example
```shell {1}
$ rv cache
/Users/rv-user/.cache/rv
PPM (https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest -> f4780dda90), path: /Users/rv-user/.cache/rv/f4780dda90
```

## `rv info`

List simple information regarding the project dependending on the flags. Used primarily to properly set the library path and
repositories during project activation in R.

### Usage
```shell
rv info [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options
* `--library` - The same as `rv library`
* `--r-version` - The R version specified in the config
* `--repositories` - The repositories specified in the config

repositories: (PPM, https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest)
```

## `rv activate`

For interactive sessions, your R session should be restarted after activation.

### Usage

```

#### Options
* `--no-r-enviroment` - Disable to `.rv` R enviroment. See [`rvr`](../reference/rvr) for more information.

## `rv deactivate`
